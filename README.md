Now the only analysis that actually makes sense

<br><br>Concluion:<br><br>
people who have never done overtime has a relatively very less chances of switching, whereas peope who has done overtime and never married has the heighest chances of switching
<br><br>
Although this is very abrubptly calculated but this might help to get ome insights on increasing Attrition rates for Indian companies
